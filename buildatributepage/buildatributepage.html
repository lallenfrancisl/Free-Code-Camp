                    Quincy founded <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>, a community of millions of people who learn to code together - both on our learning platform and through in-person
                    study groups in more than 2,000 cities around the world. Before that, he did his grad work in China through an American university, and went through an intensive Mandarin program. During his five years in China, he taught at and served
                    as an interpreter for various language training operations. He also recruited MBA students. He worked as a teacher and tutor throughout college and graduate school. He served as director of several schools in the US and China, and
                    increased their academic rigor while simultaneously growing their student populations. Along the way, he learned to code. Quincy wrote scripts to automate our school workflows so he could free teachers and administrators to spend more
                    time with students.
